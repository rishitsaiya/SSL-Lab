Lab statement 8:
October 1, 2019


Aim of this lab is to learn about linux environment, 
get familiar with linux command line and utilities. 

This lab is not evaluated. 
But it has various questions having tasks.
Please make sure that you complete these. 
------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 1 :  
 
Task 1 : Create a file abc1.txt without using an editor. 
         You can use touch command for that. 

Task 2 : put the output of 'ls' command into abc1.txt 

Task 3 : append the output of 'pwd' command to abc1.txt
 
Task 4 : view its output using 'cat' command. 
 
------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 2: 

Task 1 : Create an empty file abc2.txt  without using any editor and/or touch command. 
         Hint : Use command "cat" and "input output redirection". 
 
Task 2 : Put some contents in abc2.txt
         using cat and input-output redirection. 

Task 3 : Put some contents in abc1.txt
         using cat and input-output redirection. 

Task 4 : Append contents of abc2.txt to abc1.txt, 
         again using cat and input-output redirection. 

------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 3: output redirection using pipes. 

Task 1 : what following command does?
         ls | wc -l > count.txt

Task 2 : what following command does? Can you guess before running
         command on command line?

    echo -e "orange \npeach \ncherry" | sort > fruit

Task 3 : modify the above command to get the output sorted in reverse order. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 4: creating your own commands. 


ls -l gives many things in the output. 
First field gives permissions and the last one gives file name, 
for all the files in the specified directory.

Task 1 : Write a linux command which 
         prints only the first and last field of output of ls -l file.
         (use 'cut' command).

Task 2 : Take above output and sort them according to the size
         (increasing order).
         (use sort command)

Task 3 : This command is not built in linux.
         Can you create a separate command called 'myls' using 'aliasing. 
         you can make it permanent using '.bash_aliases' file. 

Task 4 : You can put this a shell script in the file called 'myls.sh.
         make it executable and put in your local bin directory (~/bin). 
         you may have to include your local bin into PATH variable (EXPORT variables). 
         This is another way of creating your own commands. 
         What should be the first line of a bash script?

Task 5: A bash script which runs many commands : 
        Write a bash script which does the following:
        a) lists  contents of current directory
        b) removes files with extension ".txt"
        c) lists  contents of current directory, one more time. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 5 : grep 

Task 1 : learn about this command, which is used to capture patterns in text files.
         This is closely related to your automata theory course in the next semester. 

Task 2 : use grep command to count the number of lines in given file in which word or pattern "abc".

Task 3:  Use grep to list only those files which has "abc" in it. 
         (use ls then redirect its output to grep)
         Things to learn about "wild cards".
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 6 : foreground and background processes 

Task 1 : Open a pdf file from command line using 'evince' command. 
         If you do not have evince use any of the following : libreofice, gedit etc. 
         Notice that you can not use command line.

Task 2 : If you want open any such application/command and still have
	 access to command line use 'evince file.pdf & '
         and put the process in background. 
Task 3 : you can list processes running in background by 'bg'

Task 3 : you can bring this process in foreground by using 'fg' .

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 7 : use vi or emacs editors for file handling.  
         These are  text based editors.
         If you think vi is difficult to use, read about its history, 
         on why it is called 'visual' editor :-)
